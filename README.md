# NN-to-classify-Street-House-View-Numbers

The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset
SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object
recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data formatting but comes from a
significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in
natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View
images.

Project Objectives
The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification
pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbour and a deep neural network. The goals of this
assignment are as follows:
1. Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven
approach (train/predict stages)
2. Data fetching and understand the train/val/test splits.
3. Implement and apply an optimal k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier 
4. Print the classification metric report
5. Implement and apply a deep neural network classifier including (feedforward
neural network, RELU activations)
6. Understand and be able to implement (vectorized) backpropagation (cost
stochastic gradient descent, cross entropy loss, cost functions)
7. Implement batch normalization for training the neural network 
8. Understand the differences and trade-offs between traditional and NN
classifiers with the help of classification metrics
